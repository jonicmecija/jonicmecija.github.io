        <h1>About Jonic Mecija</h1>
        <p>     
            Hi welcome! My name is Jonic Mecija and I’m a 4th year Computer Engineering student at Cal State University, 
            Long Beach. I like long walks on the beach and solving life’s most difficult problems. By living in California 
            and majoring in engineering, I get to enjoy both of those on a daily basis.
        </p>
        <p>
            While my academic courses at CSULB have mainly been focused on embedded systems and computer logic design, I have also gained 
            a strong interest in software engineering. I intend to use my skills to work on a project that 
            contributes a future of a better world.
