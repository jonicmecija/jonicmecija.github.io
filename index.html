                Hi welcome! My name is Jonic Mecija and I’m a 4th year Computer Engineering student attending California State University, 
                Long Beach. While my academic courses at CSULB have mainly been focused on embedded systems and computer logic design, 
                I've gained a strong interest in software engineering. I've recently gotten more interested in front-end web development, as it 
                allows for a fusion between two things im interested in: software and visual art/design.

        <p align="left">
                I worked at L3 Technologies in Torrance, CA as an engineering intern during the Summer of 2018. 
                My main focus was in the testing and development of the TWT’s that are placed on military and commercial satellites. 
                I was able to gain hands on lab experience with different RF tools and components. One of my side tasks were assisting 
                in data management on the internal company website through the use of basic HTML, CSS, and PHP. I was fortunate to receive 
                exposure to the aerospace industry and understand how different systems and processes are executed.
